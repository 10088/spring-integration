      Following the Spring philosophy, Spring Integration offers a number of configuration options. Which option you
      choose depends upon your particular needs and at what level you prefer to work. As with the Spring framework in
      general, it is also possible to mix and match the various techniques according to the particular problem at hand.
      For example, you may choose the XSD-based namespace for the majority of configuration combined with a handful of
      objects that are configured with annotations. Of course, it is also possible to always follow a single approach.
      The main point is that these are <emphasis>options</emphasis> for configuration - none of which are required.
      The goal is to support a user community with a wide range of needs and preferences. That said, there has also
      been a concerted effort to provide consistent naming so that, for example, the XML elements defined by the XSD
      schema will match the names of annotations, and the attributes of those XML elements will match the names of
      annotation properties. Direct usage of the API is of course always an option and is described in detail in
      <xref linkend="api"/>. We expect that most users will choose one of the higher-level options, such as the
      namespace-based or annotation-driven configuration.
