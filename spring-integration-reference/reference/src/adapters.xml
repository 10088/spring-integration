      Channel Adapters are the components responsible for interacting with external systems or other components that
      are external to the messaging system. As the name implies, the interaction consists of adapting the external
      system or component to send to and/or receive from a <interfacename>MessageChannel</interfacename>. Within
      Spring Integration, there is a distinction between <emphasis>source adapters</emphasis> and <emphasis>target
      adapters</emphasis>.
