  <title>TCP and UDP Support</title>
  <para>
    Spring Integration provides Channel Adapters for receiving and sending messages over internet protocols. Both UDP 
    (User Datagram Protocol)
    and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) adapters are provided. Each adapter provides for one-way communication 
    over the underlying protocol.
    In addition, simple inbound and outbound tcp gateways are provided. These are used when two-way communication is
    needed.

    <para>
      Two flavors each of UDP inbound and outbound adapters are provided <classname>UnicastSendingMessageHandler</classname>
      sends a datagram packet to a single destination. <classname>UnicastReceivingChannelAdapter</classname> receives 
      incoming datagram packets. <classname>MulticastSendingMessageHandler</classname> sends (broadcasts) datagram packets to
      a multicast address. <classname>MulticastReceivingChannelAdapter</classname> receives incoming datagram packets
      by joining to a multicast address.

    <para>
      Two flavors each of TCP inbound and outbound adapters are provided <classname>TcpNetSendingMessageHandler</classname>
      and <classname>TcpNioSendingMessageHandler</classname> send messages over TCP. They are functionally equivalent,
      but use different underlying technology for socket communication. Similarly, <classname>TcpNetReceivingChannelAdapter</classname>
      and <classname>TcpNioReceivingChannelAdapter</classname> are the equivalent inbound channel adapters.
      The choice of which to use in what circumstances is described below.
    </para>
    <para>
     A simple inbound TCP gateway is provided; this allows for simple request/response processing. While
     the gateway can support any number of connections, each connection can only process serially. The thread
     that reads from the socket waits for, and sends, the response before reading again.
    </para>
    <para>
     A simple outbound TCP gateway is provided; this allows for simple request/response processing. Each
     request is processed serially. The calling thread blocks on the socket until either a response is received
     or an I/O error occurs. Requests are single-threaded over the socket.

    	UDP is an efficient, but unreliable protocol. Two attributes are added to improve reliability. When check-length is
    	set to true, the adapter precedes the message data with a length field (4 bytes in network byte order). This enables
    	the receiving side to verify the length of the packet received. If a receiving system uses a buffer that is too
    	short the contain the packet, the packet can be truncated. The length header provides a mechanism to detect this.

    <title>TCP Adapters</title>
    <para>
      Two versions of TCP inbound and outbound channel adapters are provided; these adapters
      use either java.net.Socket IO, or java.nio.channels.SocketChannel IO. The choice of which
      to use depends on the application. The TcpNet* adapters use java.net.Socket and the TcpNio*
      adapters use java.nio.channels.ChannelSocket. It is not anticipated that much difference in
      performance, if any, would exist between these technologies on the outbound side. This is
      because each outbound adapter sends data over only one socket. On the receiving side 
      however, consideration should be given to the number of connections. For the 
      <classname>TcpNetReceivingChannelAdapter</classname> a thread is dedicated to receiving
      data on each connected socket; the pool size must therefore be set large enough to handle
      the expected number of connections. For the <classname>TcpNioReceivingChannelAdapter</classname>
      threads are used on an as-needed basis and it is likely that many fewer threads would be 
      needed. If a small number of connections is expected, we expect that the the TcpNetReceivingChannelAdapter
      will give the best performance. For large number of connections, the TcpNioReceivingChannelAdapter will
      likely give the best performance. In addition, the TcpNioReceivingChannelAdapter provides an 
      attribute <classname>using-direct-buffers</classname> which attempts to use direct buffers. See 
      <classname>java.nio.ByteBuffer</classname> for more information about direct buffers. 
      <tip>
        It is not expected that direct buffers will offer much, if any, performance difference. You
        should experiment with the use of TcpNxx* adapters, and direct buffers when using TcpNio*
        adapters to determine the best performance in your environment.
      </tip>
    </para>
    <para>
      TCP is a streaming protocol; this means that some structure has to be provided to data 
      transported over TCP, so the receiver can demarcate the data into discrete messages.
      Four standard message formats are provided for this purpose; you can also provide code
      for your own custom format. The first of the four standard formats is 'length-header', in which case a 4 byte 
      length header precedes the data; this is the default. The second is 'stx-etx' in which the message 
      data is preceded by an STX (0x02) character and terminated with an ETX (0x03) character.
      The third is 'crlf' in which the message is terminated with a carriage return and line feed
      (\r\n). These three formats require a byte array or String payload outbound endpoints; inbound 
      endpoints produce messages with byte array payloads. The fourth format is 'serialized' wherby
      standard java serialization is used; payloads must implement <classname>Serializable</classname>. 
      For the simple formats, the first (the default) is likely to be the most performant. This is because
      we can determine exactly how many bytes to read to obtain the complete message. The other
      two formats require examining each byte to determine if the end of the message has been 
      received. The length-header format can also handle binary data. The other two formats can only handle
      text data (specifcally, data that does not contain characters 0x02 and 0x03 for stx-etx and
      0x0d and 0x0a for crlf). This limitation can be avoided by appropriate character escaping techniques
      in the application layer. No such escaping is provided by the adapters; therefore it is not recommened
      that these formats be used without some transformation if the data may contain these characters.

  	  from the response message by writing it to the socket, using the same
  	  message format configured for the incoming message.

  	  the socket are single-threaded. Users should be aware that only one
  	  message can be handled at a time and if another thread attempts to send
  	  a message before the current response has been received, it will block. Only
  	  when the inprocess message receives a response (or times out based on the
  	  socket timeout option) will it proceed. If an error occurs while reading the 
  	  response, the socket will be closed, regardless of the close attribute.
