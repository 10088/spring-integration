  <title>TCP and UDP Support</title>
  <para>
    Spring Integration provides Channel Adapters for receiving and sending messages over internet protocols. Both UDP 
    (User Datagram Protocol)
    and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) adapters are provided. Each adapter provides for one-way communication 
    over the underlying protocol.
    In addition, simple inbound and outbound tcp gateways are provided. These are used when two-way communication is
    needed.

    <para>
      Two flavors each of UDP inbound and outbound adapters are provided <classname>UnicastSendingMessageHandler</classname>
      sends a datagram packet to a single destination. <classname>UnicastReceivingChannelAdapter</classname> receives 
      incoming datagram packets. <classname>MulticastSendingMessageHandler</classname> sends (broadcasts) datagram packets to
      a multicast address. <classname>MulticastReceivingChannelAdapter</classname> receives incoming datagram packets
      by joining to a multicast address.

      TCP inbound and outbound adapters are provided <classname>TcpSendingMessageHandler</classname>
      sends messages over TCP.  <classname>TcpReceivingChannelAdapter</classname> receives messages over TCP.
      <tip>If you have been using an earlier 2.0 milestone, note that the adapters are no longer configured 
           with connection options directly; instead, they are given
           a reference to a connection factory. See below.</tip>
    </para>
    <para>
     An inbound TCP gateway is provided; this allows for simple request/response processing. While
     the gateway can support any number of connections, each connection can only process serially. The thread
     that reads from the socket waits for, and sends, the response before reading again. If the connection factory
     is configured for single use connections, the connection is closed after the socket times out.
    </para>
    <para>
     An outbound TCP gateway is provided; this allows for simple request/response processing. 
     If the associated connection factory is configured for single use connections, a new connection is 
     immediately created  for each new request. Otherwise, if the connection is in use,
     the calling thread blocks on the connection until either a response is received or an I/O error occurs.

    	UDP is an efficient, but unreliable protocol. Two attributes are added to improve reliability. When check-length is

    	the receiving side to verify the length of the packet received. If a receiving system uses a buffer that is too
    	short the contain the packet, the packet can be truncated. The length header provides a mechanism to detect this.

    <title>TCP Connection Factories</title>
    <para>
      For TCP, the configuration of the underlying connection is provided using a
      Connection Factory. Two types of connection factory are provided; a 
      client connection factory and a server connection factory. Client connection
      factories are used to establish outgoing connections; Server connection factories
      listen for incoming connections. 
    </para>
    <para>
      A client connection factory is used
      by an outbound channel adapter but a reference to a client connection factory
      can also be provided to an inbound channel adapter and that adapter will receive
      any incoming messages received on connections created by the outbound adapter.
    </para>
    <para>
      A server connection factory is used by an inbound channel adapter (in fact
      the connection factory will not function without one). A reference to a server
      connection factory can also be provided to an outbound adapter; that adapter
      can then be used to send replies to incoming messages to the same connection.
      <tip>Reply messages will only be routed to the connection if the reply contains
      the header $ip_connection_id that was inserted into the original message by 
      the connection factory.</tip> 
      <tip>This is the extent of message correlation performed when sharing connection
      factories between inbound and outbound adapters. Such sharing allows for 
      asynchronous two-way communication over TCP. Only payload information is
      transferred using TCP; therefore any message correlation must be performed
      by downstream components such as aggregators or other endpoints.</tip>
    </para>
    <para>
      A maximum of one adapter of each type may be given a reference to a connection
      factory.
    </para>

      TCP is a streaming protocol; this means that some structure has to be provided to data 
      transported over TCP, so the receiver can demarcate the data into discrete messages.
      Connection factories are configured to use converters to convert between the message 
      payload and the bits that are sent over TCP. This is accomplished by providing an 
      input converter and output converter for inbound and outbound messages respectively.
      Four standard converters are provided; the first is <classname>ByteArrayCrlfConverter</classname>,
      which can convert a String or byte array to a stream of bytes followed by carriage 
      return and linefeed characters (\r\n). This is the default converter and can be used with 
      telnet as a client, for example. The second is is <classname>ByteArrayStxEtxConverter</classname>,
      which can convert a String or byte array to a stream of bytes preceded by an STX (0x02) and
      followed by an ETX (0x03). The third is <classname>ByteArrayLengthHeaderConverter</classname>,
      which can convert a String or byte array to a stream of bytes preceded by a 4 byte binary
      length in network byte order. Each of these converts an input stream containing the 
      corresponding format to a byte array payload. The fourth converter is 
      <classname>JavaSerializationConverter</classname> which can be used to convert any
      Serializable objects. We expect to provide other serialization technologies but you may also
      supply your own by implementing the <classname>InputStreamingConverter</classname> and
      <classname>OutputStreamingConverter</classname> interfaces. If you do not wish to use
      the default converters, you must supply <classname>input-converter</classname> and 
      <classname>output-converter</classname> attributes on the connection factory (example below).
      <tip>This converter mechanism replaces the previous mechanism of subclassing the 
      NxxSocketReader and NxxSocketWriter</tip>

    <para>
      <tip>
        Normally, with shared connections, one would expect the the same wire protocol
        to be used for both inbound and outbound messages; however, the configuration
        allows them to be different. Note, however that if you only specify one converter
        the other direction will use the default converter.
      </tip>
    </para>
    <para>
        Connection factories can be configured with a reference to a 
        <classname>TcpConnectionInterceptorFactoryChain</classname>. Interceptors can be used
        to add behavior to connections, such as negotiation, security, and other setup.
        Further documentation to follow.

    <title>TCP Adapters</title>
    <para>
      TCP inbound and outbound channel adapters that utilize the above connection 
      factories are provided. These adapters have just 2 attributes
      <classname>connection-factory</classname> and <classname>channel</classname>.
      The channel attribute specifies the channel on which messages arrive at an
      outbound adapter and on which messages are placed by an inbound adapter.
      The connection factory indicates which connection factory is to be used to
      manage connections for the adapter. While both inbound and outbound adapters
      can share a connection factory, server connection factories are always 'owned'
      by an inbound adapter; client connection factories are always 'owned' by an
      outbound adapter. One, and only one, adapter of each type may get a reference
      to a connection factory.

      In this configuration, messages arriving in channel 'input'
      are serialized over connections created by 'client' received

      the input channel for 'outboundServer' the message is simply
      looped back over the same connection and received by 
      'inboundClient' and deposited in channel 'replies'.

              <entry>Specifies the concurrency.  For tcp, not using nio, specifies the

                     using nio, specifies the number of tcp fragments that are concurrently
                     reassembled into complete messages. 
                     It only applies in this sense if task-executor is not configured. 
		     However, pool-size is also used for the server socket backlog, 
                     regardless of whether an external task executor is used. Defaults to 5.</entry>
