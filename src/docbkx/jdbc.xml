  <para>Spring Integration provides Channel Adapters for receiving and sending
  messages via database queries.</para>

  <section id="jdbc-inbound-channel-adapter">
    <title>Inbound Channel Adapter</title>

    <para>The main function of an inbound Channel Adapter is to execute a SQL
    <code>SELECT</code> query and turn the result set into a message. The
    message payload is the whole result set, expressed as a
    <classname>List</classname>, and the types of the items in the list
    depends on the row-mapping strategy that is used. The default strategy is
    a generic mapper that just returns a <classname>Map</classname> for each
    row i nthe query. Optionally this can be changed by adding a reference to
    requires a reference to a <classname>RowMapper</classname> instance (see
    the <ulink
    url="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/jdbc.html">Spring
    JDBC</ulink> documentation for more detailed information about row
    mapping).<note>
        <para>If you want to convert rows in the SELECT query result to
        individual messages you can use a downstream splitter.</para>
      </note></para>

    <para>The inbound adapter also requires a reference to either
    <classname>JdbcTemplate</classname> instance or
    <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename>. The following example defines
    an inbound Channel Adapter with a <classname>DataSource</classname>
    reference. <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<jdbc:inbound-channel-adapter query="select * from item where status=2" 
  channel="target" data-source="dataSource" 
  update="update item set status=10 where id in (:idList)" />]]></programlisting>
    <note>
         The parameters in the update query are specified with a colon (:) prefix to the name of a map key. This is a standard feature of the named parameter JDBC support in Spring JDBC. 
      </note></para>

    <para>As well as the <code>SELECT</code> statement to generate the
    messages, the adapter above also has an <code>UPDATE</code> statement that
    is being used to mark the records as processed, so they don't show up in
    the next poll. The update is parameterised by the list of ids from the
    original select. This is done through a naming convention by default (a
    column in the input result set called "id" is translated into a list in
    the parameter map for the update called "idList"). To change the parameter
    generation strategy you can inject a
    <classname>SqlParameterSourceFactory</classname> into the adapter to
    override the default behaviour (the adapter has a
    <code>sql-parameter-source-factory</code> attribute).</para>

    <section>
      <title>Polling and Transactions</title>

      <para>The inbound adapter accepts a regular Spring Integration poller as
      a sub element, so for instance the frequency of the polling can be
      controlled. A very important feature of the poller for JDBC usage is the
      option to wrap the poll operation in a transaction, for example:</para>

      <programlisting><![CDATA[<jdbc:inbound-channel-adapter query="..." 
  channel="target" data-source="dataSource" 
  update="...">
  <poller>
    <interval-trigger interval="1000"/>
    <transactional/>
  </poller>
</jdbc:inbound-channel-adapter>]]></programlisting>

      <para><note>
           If a poller is not explicitly specified a default value will be used (and as per normal with Spring Integration can be defined as a top level bean) 
        </note> In this example the database is polled every 1000
      milliseconds, and the update and select queries are both executed in the
      same transaction. The transaction manager configuration is not shown,
      but as long as it is aware of the data source then the poll is
      transactional. A common use case is for the downstream channels to be
      direct channels (the default), so that the endpoints are invoked in the
      same thread, and hence the same transaction. then if any of them fails,
      the transaction rolls back and the input data are reverted to their
      original state.</para>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section id="jdbc-outbound-channel-adapter">
    <title>Outbound Channel Adapter</title>

    <para>The outbound Channel Adapter is the inverse of the inbound: its role
    is to handle a message and use it to execute a SQL query. The message
    payload and headers are available by default as input parameters to the
    query, for instance: <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<jdbc:outbound-channel-adapter 
  query="insert into foos (id, status, name) values (:headers[$id], 0, :payload[foo])"
  channel="input" data-source="dataSource"/>]]></programlisting> In the
    example above, messages arriving on the channel "input" have a payload of
    a map with key "foo", so the <code>[]</code> operator dereferences that
    value from the map. The headers are also accessed as a map. <note>
         The parameters in the query above are bean paths in the incoming message (they are not Spring EL expressions). This behaviour is part of the 

        <classname>MapSqlParameterSource</classname>

         in Spring JDBC, which is the default source created by the outbound adapter. Other behaviour is possible in the adapter, and only requires the user to inject a different 

        <classname>SqlParameterSourceFactory</classname>

         . 
      </note></para>

    <para>The outbound adapter requires a reference to either a DataSource or
    a JdbcTemplate. It can also have a
    <classname>SqlParameterSourceFactory</classname> injected to control the
    binding of incoming message to the query.</para>

    <para>If the input channel is a direct channel then the outbound adapter
    runs its query in the same thread, and therefor ethe same transaction (if
    there is one) as the sender of the message.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Message Store</title>

    <para>The JDBC module provides an implementation of the Spring Integration
    <classname>MessageStore</classname> (important in the Claim Check pattern)
    and <classname>MessageGroupStore</classname> (important in stateful
    patterns like Aggregator) backed by a database. Both interfaces are
    implemented by the JdbcMessageStore and there is also support for
    configuring store instances in XML. For example:</para>

    <programlisting><![CDATA[<jdbc:message-store id="messageStore" data-source="dataSource"/>]]></programlisting>

    <para>A <classname>JdbcTemplate</classname> can be specified instead of a
    <classname>DataSource</classname>.</para>

    <para>Other optional attributes are show in the next example:</para>

    <para><programlisting><![CDATA[<jdbc:message-store id="messageStore" data-source="dataSource"
  lob-handler="lobHandler" table-prefix="MY_INT_"/>]]></programlisting>Here we
    have specified a <classname>LobHandler</classname> for dealing with
    messages as large objects (e.g. often necessary if using Oracle) and a
    prefix for the table names in the queries generated by the store. The
    table name prefix defaults to "INT_".</para>

    <section>
      <title>Initializing the Database</title>

      <para>Spring Integration ships with some sample scripts that can be used
      to initialize a database. In the spring-integration-jdbc JAR file you
      will find scripts in the
      <classname>org.springframework.integration.jdbc</classname> package:
      there is a create and a drop script example for a range of common
      database platforms. A common way to use these scripts is to reference
      them in a <ulink
      url="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/jdbc.html#d0e24182">Spring
      JDBC data source initializer</ulink>. Note that the scripts are provided
      as samples or specifications of the the required table and column names.
      You may find that you need to enhance them for production use (e.g. with
      index declarations).</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Partitioning a Message Store</title>

      <para>It is common to use a <classname>JdbcMessageStore</classname> as a
      global store for a group of applications, or nodes in the same
      application. To provide some portection against name clashes, and to
      give control over the database meta-data configuration, the message
      store allows the tables to be partitioned in two ways. One is to use
      separate table names, by changing the prefix as described above, and the
      other is to specify a "region" name for partitioning data within a
      single table. An important use case for this is using the store to
      manage persistent queues backing a Spring Integration channel. The
      message data for a persistent channel is keyed in the store on the
      channel name, so if the channel names are not globally unique then there
      is the danger of channels picking up data that was not intended for
      them. To avoid this the message store region can be used to keep data
      separate for different physical channels that happen to have the same
      logical name.</para>
