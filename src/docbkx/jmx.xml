  <title>JMX Support</title>

  <para>Spring Integration provides Channel Adapters for receiving and
  publishing JMX Notifications. There is also an inbound Channel Adapter for
  polling JMX MBean attribute values, and an outbound Channel Adapter for
  invoking JMX MBean operations.</para>

  <section id="jmx-notification-listening-channel-adapter">
    <title>Notification Listening Channel Adapter</title>

    <para>The Notification-listening Channel Adapter requires a JMX ObjectName
    for the MBean that publishes Notifications to which this listener should
    be registered. A very simple configuration might look like this:
    <programlisting language="xml"> &lt;jmx:notification-listening-channel-adapter id="adapter"
                   channel="channel"
                   object-name="example.domain:name=publisher"/&gt;
</programlisting> <tip>
         The 

        <emphasis>notification-listening-channel-adapter</emphasis>

         registers with an MBeanServer at startup, and the default bean name is "mbeanServer" which happens to be the same bean name generated when using Spring's &lt;context:mbean-server/&gt; element. If you need to use a different name be sure to include the "mbean-server" attribute. 
      </tip> The adapter can also accept a reference to a NotificationFilter
    and a "handback" Object to provide some context that is passed back with
    each Notification. Both of those attributes are optional. Extending the
    above example to include those attributes as well as an explicit
    MBeanServer bean name would produce the following: <programlisting
    language="xml"> &lt;jmx:notification-listening-channel-adapter id="adapter"
                   channel="channel"
                   mbean-server="someServer"
                   object-name="example.domain:name=somePublisher"
                   notification-fliter="notificationFilter"
                   handback="myHandback"/&gt;
</programlisting> Since the notification-listening adapter is registered with
    the MBeanServer directly, it is event-driven and does not require any
    poller configuration.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="jmx-notification-publishing-channel-adapter">
    <title>Notification Publishing Channel Adapter</title>

    <para>The Notification-publishing Channel Adapter is relatively simple. It
    only requires a JMX ObjectName in its configuration as shown below.
    <programlisting language="xml"> &lt;context:mbean:export/&gt;

 &lt;jmx:notification-publishing-channel-adapter id="adapter" 
                              channel="channel"
                              object-name="example.domain:name=publisher"/&gt;
</programlisting> It does also require that an MBeanExporter be present in the
    context. That is why the &lt;context:mbean-export/&gt; element is shown
    above as well.</para>

    <para>When Messages are sent to the channel for this adapter, the
    Notification is created from the Message content. If the payload is a
    String it will be passed as the "message" text for the Notification. Any
    other payload type will be passed as the "userData" of the
    Notification.</para>

    <para>JMX Notifications also have a "type", and it should be a
    dot-delimited String. There are two ways to provide the type. Precedence
    will always be given to a Message header value associated with the
    JmxHeaders.NOTIFICATION_TYPE key. On the other hand, you can rely on a
    fallback "default-notification-type" attribute provided in the
    configuration. <programlisting language="xml"> &lt;context:mbean:export/&gt;

 &lt;jmx:notification-publishing-channel-adapter id="adapter" 
                              channel="channel"
                              object-name="example.domain:name=publisher"
                              default-notification-type="some.default.type"/&gt;
</programlisting></para>
  </section>

  <section id="jmx-attribute-polling-channel-adapter">
    <title>Attribute Polling Channel Adapter</title>

    <para>The attribute polling adapter is useful when you have a requirement
    to periodically check on some value that is available through an MBean as
    a managed attribute. The poller can be configured in the same way as any
    other polling adapter in Spring Integration (or it's possible to rely on
    the default poller). The "object-name" and "attribute-name" are required.
    An MBeanServer reference is also required, but it will automatically check
    for a bean named "mbeanServer" by default just like the
    notification-listening-channel-adapter described above. <programlisting
    language="xml"> &lt;jmx:attribute-polling-channel-adapter id="adapter"
                channel="channel"
                object-name="example.domain:name=someService"
                attribute-name="InvocationCount"&gt;
     &lt;si:poller max-messages-per-poll="1" fixed-rate="5000"/&gt;
 &lt;/jmx:attribute-polling-channel-adapter&gt;
</programlisting></para>
  </section>

  <section id="jmx-operation-invoking-channel-adapter">
    <title>Operation Invoking Channel Adapter</title>

    <para>The <emphasis>operation-invoking-channel-adapter</emphasis> enables
    Message-driven invocation of any managed operation exposed by an MBean.
    Each invocation requires the operation name to be invoked and the
    ObjectName of the target MBean. Both of these must be explicitly provided
    via adapter configuration: <programlisting language="xml"> &lt;jmx:operation-invoking-channel-adapter id="adapter"
                object-name="example.domain:name=TestBean"
                operation-name="ping"/&gt;
</programlisting> Then the adapter only needs to be able to discover the
    "mbeanServer" bean. If a different bean name is required, then provide the
    "mbean-server" attribute with a reference.</para>

    <para>The payload of the Message will be mapped to the parameters of the
    operation, if any. A Map-typed payload with String keys is treated as
    name/value pairs whereas a List or array would be passed as a simple
    argument list (with no explicit parameter names). If the operation
    requires a single parameter value, then the payload can represent that
    single value, and if the operation requires no parameters, then the
    payload would be ignored.</para>

    <para>If you want to expose a channel for a single common operation to be
    invoked by Messages that need not contain headers, then that option works
    well.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="jmx-operation-invoking-outbound-gateway">
    <title>Operation Invoking outbound Gateway</title>

    <para>Similar to <emphasis>operation-invoking-channel-adapter</emphasis>
    Spring Integration also provides
    <emphasis>operation-invoking-outbound-gateway</emphasis> which could be
    used when dealing with non-void operations and return value is required.
    Such return value will be sent as message payload to the 'reply-channel'
    specified by this Gateway. <programlisting language="xml"> &lt;jmx:operation-invoking-outbound-gateway request-channel="requestChannel"
   reply-channel="replyChannel"
   object-name="org.springframework.integration.jmx.config:type=TestBean,name=testBeanGateway"
   operation-name="testWithReturn"/&gt;</programlisting> Another way of
    provideing the 'reply-channel' is by setting
    <interfacename>MessageHeaders.REPLY_CHANNEL</interfacename> Message
    Header</para>
  </section>

  <section id="jmx-mbean-exporter">
    <title>MBean Exporter</title>

    <para>Spring Integration components themselves may be exposed as MBeans
    when the <classname>IntegrationMBeanExporter</classname> is configured. To
    create an instance of the <classname>IntegrationMBeanExporter</classname>,
    define a bean and provide a reference to an MBeanServer and a domain name
    (if desired). The domain can be left out in which case the default domain
    is "spring.application". <programlisting language="xml"> &lt;jmx:mbean-exporter domain="my.company.domain" mbean-server="mbeanServer"/&gt;

 &lt;bean id="mbeanServer" class="org.springframework.jmx.support.MBeanServerFactoryBean"&gt;
     &lt;property name="locateExistingServerIfPossible" value="true"/&gt;
 &lt;/bean&gt;</programlisting></para>

    <para>The MBean exporter is orthogonal to the one provided in Spring core
    - it registers message channels and message handlers, but not itself (you
    can expose the exporter itself using the standard
    <literal>&lt;context:mbean-export/&gt;</literal> tag).</para>
  </section>

  <section id="jmx-control-bus">
    <title>Control Bus</title>

    <para>As described in (<ulink
    url="http://www.eaipatterns.com/ControlBus.html">EIP</ulink>), the idea
    behind the Control Bus is that the same messaging system can be used for
    monitoring and managing the components within the framework as is used for
    "application-level" messaging. In Spring Integration we build upon the
    adapters described above so that it's possible to send Messages as a means
    of invoking exposed operations. Internally, the Control Bus uses a Spring
    MBeanExporter instance to expose the various endpoints and channels. To
    create an instance of the Control Bus, define a bean and provide a
    reference to an MBeanServer and a domain name. <programlisting
    language="xml"> &lt;jmx:control-bus mbean-exporter="mbeanExporter" operation-channel="operationChannel"/&gt;

 &lt;jmx:mbean-exporter id="mbeanExporter" mbean-server="mbeanServer"/&gt;
</programlisting></para>

    <para>The Control Bus has an "operationChannel" that can be accessed for
    invoking operations on the MBeans that it has exported. This will also be
    covered by namespace support soon to make it easier to configure
    references to that channel for other producers. We will likely add some
    other channels for notifications and attribute polling as well.</para>

    <para>The Control Bus functionality is a work in progress. At this time,
    one can perform some basic monitoring of Message Channels and/or invoke
    Lifecycle operations (start/stop) on Message Endpoints. Now that the
    foundation is available, however, we will be able to extend the attributes
    and operations that are being exposed.</para>
