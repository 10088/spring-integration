  <title>Control Bus</title>

  <para>As described in (EIP), the idea behind the Control Bus is that
  the same messaging system can be used for monitoring and managing
  the components within the framework as is used for
  "application-level" messaging. In Spring Integration we build upon
  the adapters described above so that it's possible to send Messages
  as a means of invoking exposed operations.</para>

  <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[
<groovy:control-bus input-channel="operationChannel"/>]]></programlisting>

  <para>The Control Bus has an input channel that can be accessed for
  invoking operations on the beans in the application context.  It
  also has all the common properties of a service activating endpoint,
  e.g. you can specify an output channel if the result of the
  operation has a return value that you want to send on to a
  downsatrem channel.
  </para>

  <para>The Control Bus executes messages on the input channel as
  Spring Expression Language expressions.  It takes a message,
  compiles the body to an expression, adds some context, and then
  executes it.  The default context just exposes all the beans in the
  application context by name.
