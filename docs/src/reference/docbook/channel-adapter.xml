  <title>Channel Adapter</title>
  <para>
    A Channel Adapter is a Message Endpoint that enables connecting a single sender or receiver to a Message Channel.
    Spring Integration provides a number of adapters out of the box to support various transports, such as JMS, File,
    HTTP, Web Services, and Mail. Those will be discussed in upcoming chapters of this reference guide. However, this
    chapter focuses on the simple but flexible Method-invoking Channel Adapter support. There are both inbound and
    outbound adapters, and each may be configured with XML elements provided in the core namespace.

  <section id="channel-adapter-namespace-inbound">
    <title>Configuring Inbound Channel Adapter</title>
    <para>
      An "inbound-channel-adapter" element can invoke any method on a Spring-managed Object and send a non-null return
      value to a <interfacename>MessageChannel</interfacename> after converting it to a <classname>Message</classname>.
      When the adapter's subscription is activated, a poller will attempt to receive messages from the source. The
      poller will be scheduled with the <interfacename>TaskScheduler</interfacename> according to the provided
      configuration. To configure the polling interval or cron expression for an individual channel-adapter,
      provide a 'poller' element with either an 'interval-trigger' (in milliseconds) or 'cron-trigger'
      sub-element.
      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<inbound-channel-adapter ref="source1" method="method1" channel="channel1">
    <poller fixed-rate="5000"/>
</inbound-channel-adapter>

<inbound-channel-adapter ref="source2" method="method2" channel="channel2">
    <poller cron="30 * 9-17 * * MON-FRI"/>
</channel-adapter>]]></programlisting>
    </para>
    <note>
      <para>
        If no poller is provided, then a single default poller must be registered within the context.
        See <xref linkend="endpoint-namespace"/> for more detail.

  <section id="channel-adapter-namespace-outbound">
    <title>Configuring Outbound Channel Adapter</title>
    <para>
      An "outbound-channel-adapter" element can also connect a <interfacename>MessageChannel</interfacename> to any POJO consumer
      method that should be invoked with the payload of Messages sent to that channel.
      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<outbound-channel-adapter channel="channel1" ref="target1" method="method1"/>]]></programlisting>
      If the channel being adapted is a <interfacename>PollableChannel</interfacename>, provide a poller sub-element:
        <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<outbound-channel-adapter channel="channel2" ref="target2" method="method2">
    ]]><emphasis><![CDATA[<poller fixed-rate="3000"/>
]]></emphasis><![CDATA[
</outbound-channel-adapter>
<beans:bean id="target1" class="org.bar.Foo"/>
]]></programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      Using a "ref" attribute is generally recommended if the POJO consumer implementation can be reused
      in other <code>&lt;outbound-channel-adapter&gt;</code> definitions. However if the consumer implementation
      should be scoped to a single definition of the <code>&lt;outbound-channel-adapter&gt;</code>, you can define it as inner bean:
        <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<outbound-channel-adapter channel="channel2" method="method2">
        <beans:bean class="org.bar.Foo"/>
    ]]><![CDATA[
</outbound-channel-adapter>
]]></programlisting>
    </para>
    <note>
    <para>
    Using both the "ref" attribute and an inner handler definition in the same <code>&lt;outbound-channel-adapter&gt;</code>
    configuration is not allowed, as it creates an ambiguous condition and will result in an Exception being thrown.
    </para>
    </note>
    <para>
      Any Channel Adapter can be created without a "channel" reference in which case it will implicitly create an
      instance of <classname>DirectChannel</classname>. The created channel's name will match the "id" attribute
      of the &lt;inbound-channel-adapter/&gt; or &lt;outbound-channel-adapter&gt; element. Therefore, if the "channel"
      is not provided, the "id" is required.
