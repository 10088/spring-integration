  <section id="mail-outbound">
    <title>Mail-Sending Channel Adapter</title>
    <para>
      Spring Integration provides support for outbound email with the
      <classname>MailSendingMessageHandler</classname>. It delegates to a configured instance of Spring's
      <interfacename>JavaMailSender</interfacename>:
      <programlisting language="java"> JavaMailSender mailSender = context.getBean("mailSender", JavaMailSender.class);

 MailSendingMessageHandler mailSendingHandler = new MailSendingMessageHandler(mailSender);</programlisting>
      <classname>MailSendingMessageHandler</classname> has various mapping strategies that use Spring's
      <interfacename>MailMessage</interfacename> abstraction. If the received Message's payload is already
      a <classname>MailMessage</classname> instance, it will be sent directly.
      Therefore, it is generally recommended to precede this
      consumer with a Transformer for non-trivial MailMessage construction requirements. However, a few simple
      Message mapping strategies are supported out-of-the-box. For example, if the message payload is a byte array,
      then that will be mapped to an attachment. For simple text-based emails, you can provide a String-based
      Message payload. In that case, a MailMessage will be created with that String as the text content. If you
      are working with a Message payload type whose toString() method returns appropriate mail text content, then
      consider adding Spring Integration's <emphasis>ObjectToStringTransformer</emphasis> prior to the outbound
      Mail adapter (see the example within <xref linkend="transformer-namespace"/> for more detail).
    </para>
    <para>
      The outbound MailMessage may also be configured with certain values from the
      <classname>MessageHeaders</classname>. If available, values will be mapped to the outbound mail's
      properties, such as the recipients (TO, CC, and BCC), the from/reply-to, and the subject. The header names are
      defined by the following constants:
      <programlisting language="java"> MailHeaders.SUBJECT
 MailHeaders.TO
 MailHeaders.CC
 MailHeaders.BCC
 MailHeaders.FROM
 MailHeaders.REPLY_TO</programlisting>
    </para>
    <note>
      <classname>MailHeaders</classname>  also allows you to override corresponding <classname>MailMessage</classname> values.
      For example: If <classname>MailMessage.to</classname> is set to 'foo@bar.com' and <classname>MailHeaders.TO</classname>
      Message header is provided it will take precedence and override the corresponding value in <classname>MailMessage</classname>

  <section id="mail-inbound">
    <title>Mail-Receiving Channel Adapter</title>
    <para>
      Spring Integration also provides support for inbound email with the
      <classname>MailReceivingMessageSource</classname>. It delegates to a configured instance of Spring
      Integration's own <interfacename>MailReceiver</interfacename> interface, and there are two implementations:
      <classname>Pop3MailReceiver</classname> and <classname>ImapMailReceiver</classname>. The easiest way to
      instantiate either of these is by passing the 'uri' for a Mail store to the receiver's constructor. For example:
      <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[ MailReceiver receiver = new Pop3MailReceiver("pop3://usr:pwd@localhost/INBOX");
]]></programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      Another option for receiving mail is the IMAP "idle" command (if supported by the mail server you are using).
      Spring Integration provides the <classname>ImapIdleChannelAdapter</classname> which is itself a Message-producing
      endpoint. It delegates to an instance of the <classname>ImapMailReceiver</classname> but enables asynchronous
      reception of Mail Messages. There are examples in the next section of configuring both types of inbound Channel
      Adapter with Spring Integration's namespace support in the 'mail' schema.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section id="mail-namespace">
    <title>Mail Namespace Support</title>
    <para>
      Spring Integration provides a namespace for mail-related configuration. To use it, configure the following schema
      locations.<programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xmlns:mail="http://www.springframework.org/schema/integration/mail"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
            http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-3.0.xsd
            http://www.springframework.org/schema/integration/mail
            http://www.springframework.org/schema/integration/mail/spring-integration-mail-2.0.xsd">]]></programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      To configure an outbound Channel Adapter, provide the channel to receive from, and the MailSender:
      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<mail:outbound-channel-adapter channel="outboundMail"
                              mail-sender="mailSender"/>]]></programlisting>
      Alternatively, provide the host, username, and password:
      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<mail:outbound-channel-adapter channel="outboundMail"
                              host="somehost" username="someuser" password="somepassword"/>]]></programlisting>
      <note>
        Keep in mind, as with any outbound Channel Adapter, if the referenced channel is a PollableChannel, a
        &lt;poller&gt; sub-element should be provided with either an interval-trigger or cron-trigger.
      </note>
    </para>
    <para>
      To configure an inbound Channel Adapter, you have the choice between polling or event-driven (assuming your
      mail server supports IMAP IDLE - if not, then polling is the only option). A polling Channel Adapter simply
      requires the store URI and the channel to send inbound Messages to. The URI may begin with "pop3" or "imap":
      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<int-mail:inbound-channel-adapter id="imapAdapter"
      store-uri="imaps://[username]:[password]@imap.gmail.com/INBOX"
      java-mail-properties="javaMailProperties"
      channel="recieveChannel"
      should-delete-messages="true"
      should-mark-messages-as-read="true"
      auto-startup="true">
      <int:poller max-messages-per-poll="1" fixed-rate="5000"/>
</int-mail:inbound-channel-adapter>]]></programlisting>
      If you do have IMAP idle support, then you may want to configure the "imap-idle-channel-adapter" element instead.
      Since the "idle" command enables event-driven notifications, no poller is necessary for this adapter. It will
      send a Message to the specified channel as soon as it receives the notification that new mail is available:
      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<int-mail:imap-idle-channel-adapter id="customAdapter"
      store-uri="imaps://[username]:[password]@imap.gmail.com/INBOX"
      channel="recieveChannel"
      auto-startup="true"
      should-delete-messages="false"
      should-mark-messages-as-read="true"
      java-mail-properties="javaMailProperties"/>]]></programlisting>
    ... where <emphasis>javaMailProperties</emphasis> could be provided by creating and populating
     a regular <classname>java.utils.Properties</classname> object. For example via <emphasis>util</emphasis> namespace
     provided by Spring.
     <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<util:properties id="javaMailProperties">
  <prop key="mail.imap.socketFactory.class">javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory</prop>
  <prop key="mail.imap.socketFactory.fallback">false</prop>
  <prop key="mail.store.protocol">imaps</prop>
  <prop key="mail.debug">false</prop>
</util:properties>]]></programlisting>
    </para>

    <important>
    In both configurations <code>channel</code> and <code>should-delete-messages</code> are the <emphasis>REQUIRED</emphasis>
    attributes. The important thing to understand is why <code>should-delete-messages</code> is required?
    The issue is with POP3 protocol, which does NOT have any knowlege of messages that were READ. It can only know what's been read 
    within a single session. This means that when your POP3 mail adapter is running emails are successfully consumed as as they become available during each poll
    and no single email message will be delivered more then once. However, as soon as you restart your adapter and begin a new session
    all the email messages that might have been retreeved in the previous session will be retrieved again. That is the nature of POP3. Some might argue
    that why not set <code>should-delete-messages</code> to TRUE by default? Becouse there are two valid amd mutually exclusive use cases 
    which makes it very hard pick the right default. You may want to configure your adapter as the only email receiever in which
    case you want to be able to restart such adapter without fear that messages that were delivered before will not be redelivered again. 
    In this case setting <code>should-delete-messages</code> to TRUE would make most sence. However, you may have anoher use case where 
    you may want to have multiple adapters that simply monitor email servers and their content. In other words you just want to 'peek but not touch'. 
    Then setting <code>should-delete-messages</code> to FALSE would be much more appropriate. So since it is hard to choose what should be
    the right default value for <code>should-delete-messages</code> attribute we simply made it required to be set - leaving it up to you
    while also not letting you to forget that you must set it.
    </important>

     <note>When configuring a polling adapter (e.g., inbound-channel-adapter) <emphasis>should-mark-messages-as-read</emphasis>
    be aware of the protocol you are configuring to retrieve messages. For example POP3 does not support this flag
    which means setting it to either value will have no effect as messages will NOT be marked as read</note>


    <para>
      When using the namespace support, a <emphasis>header-enricher</emphasis> Message Transformer is also available.
      This simplifies the application of the headers mentioned above to any Message prior to sending to the
      Mail-sending Channel Adapter.
      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<mail:header-enricher subject="Example Mail"
                     to="to@example.org"
                     cc="cc@example.org"
                     bcc="bcc@example.org"
                     from="from@example.org"
                     reply-to="replyTo@example.org"
                     overwrite="false"/>]]></programlisting>
    </para>
